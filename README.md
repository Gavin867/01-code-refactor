<h2>AKA: The Horiseon Code Refactor Exercise</h2>

**Project Description**

The puspose of this exercise was to update the 'Horiseon' webpage files to use HTML5 semantics and more efficicient CSS code without changing the appearance/functionality of the page. In order to allow for comparison, this repository contains two project folders.

The **original-code** folder contains the original index.html and css.style code with two main exceptions:

 * The image and css links have been changed to reflect newer/simpler folder locations. 
 
 * Comments have been added to identifiy where semantic tags can be used and to also identfiy inefficiencies in the css.

The **refacted-code** folder contains the refacted code with my semantic and css changes. These changes include the following:

* Replacement of the 'div' tags with appropriate semantic tags.
* Use of alt="" to provide descriptions of images
* Fixing broken navigation "Search Engine Optimization" link by replacing .class with #id
* Elimination of superfluous lines of css code by correct use of .class
* Comments describing the changes
