**The Horiseon Code Refactor Exercise**

**Project Description**

The puspose of this exercise was to update the 'Horiseon' webpage files to use HTML5 semantics and more efficicient CSS code without changing the appearance/functionality of the page. In order to allow for comparison, this repository contains two project folders:

* The **original-code** folder contains the original index.html and css.style code with two main exceptions. The image and css links have been changed to reflect newer/simpler folder locations. Comments have been added to identifiy where semantic tags can be used and to also identfiy inefficiency in the css.

* The **refacted-code** folder contains the code with my semantic changes. These changes include the following:

    Replacement of the 'div' tags with semantic tags.
